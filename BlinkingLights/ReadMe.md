Arduino LED Blink Sequence

This Arduino sketch is designed to control a sequence of LED blinks on pins 5 through 13 of an Arduino board. It utilizes loops to blink LEDs in different patterns with varying delays.

Hardware Requirements
Arduino Board (e.g., Arduino Uno)

LEDs (You can use 9 LEDs, one for each of pins 5 through 13)
Note: You may want different colors or all the same color.

Resistors (Typically 220立 to 1k立)
Note: I did not do this but it is good practice.

Breadboard and Jumper Wires

Circuit Setup
Connect LEDs to digital pins 5 through 13 on the Arduino board.

Connect a current-limiting resistor (220立 or 1k立) in series with each LED.

Connect the other leg of each LED to ground (GND).

Software Requirements
Arduino IDE (or compatible IDE)
