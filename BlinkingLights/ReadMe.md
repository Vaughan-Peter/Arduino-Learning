# Arduino LED Blink Sequence

This Arduino sketch is designed to control a sequence of LED blinks on pins 5 through 13 of an Arduino board. It utilizes loops to blink LEDs in different patterns with varying delays.

## Hardware Requirements

- Arduino Board (e.g., Arduino Uno)
- LEDs (You can use 9 LEDs, one for each of pins 5 through 13)
  - **Note**: You may want different colors or all the same color.
- Resistors (Typically 220立 to 1k立)
  - **Note**: I did not do this but it is good practice.
- Breadboard and Jumper Wires

## Circuit Setup

1. Connect LEDs to digital pins 5 through 13 on the Arduino board.
2. Connect a current-limiting resistor (220立 or 1k立) in series with each LED.
3. Connect the other leg of each LED to ground (GND).
