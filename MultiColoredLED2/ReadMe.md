# Arduino Learning Projects

Welcome to my collection of Arduino experiments and learning projects!  
This repository explores different sensors, modules, and programming techniques — from simple LED fades to more advanced interactive circuits.

## 🧠 Overview
Each folder in this repository contains a self-contained Arduino project with:
- Wiring details  
- Example code (`.ino` files)  
- Notes or documentation about the module used  
- Optional related videos and demos  

These projects are great for beginners looking to understand the basics of microcontrollers and for hobbyists experimenting with new ideas.
