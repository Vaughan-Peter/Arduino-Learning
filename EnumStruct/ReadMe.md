# Arduino Random LED Light Show ðŸŽ‡

This project demonstrates how to control **six LEDs** on an Arduino Uno (pins D8â€“D13) with **random blink intervals**.  
It uses an **enum class** for type-safe HIGH/LOW states and a **struct** to keep LED logic clean and organized.  

Each LED gets its own random interval and blinks independently using `millis()`, avoiding `delay()` so everything runs smoothly in parallel.  
The Arduino is powered by a **portable USB battery bank**, making it completely mobile.

## ðŸ”¹ Features
- âœ… **Enum class** for HIGH/LOW states (type safety).  
- âœ… **Struct** to store pin, state, and timing.  
- âœ… Each LED blinks with its **own random interval**.  
- âœ… **Non-blocking timing** with `millis()` (no delays).  
- âœ… Runs on a **portable power bank** for mobility.

## ðŸ”¹ Circuit Setup
- 6 LEDs connected to **pins 8â€“13**  
- **220Î© resistors** in series with each LED  
- Common **GND** shared with Arduino Uno  
- Arduino powered by a **USB battery bank**

## ðŸ”¹ Code
The code is split into two files:  

- `EnumStruct.ino` â†’ main program loop  
- `LedControl.h` â†’ reusable LED struct logic
