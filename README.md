This repository will be updated with code featured in my current YouTube videos about Arduino. The goal of this channel and GitHub repo is to promote learning in programming and hardware design. Iâ€™m passionate about sharing knowledge and equally eager to learn from others. Feel free to reach out to me on LinkedIn or connect via YouTube for questions or discussions.
