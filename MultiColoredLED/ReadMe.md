# MultiColoredLED – Arduino KY-016 RGB LED Project

This project demonstrates how to control a **KY-016 RGB LED module** with an **Arduino Uno** using **PWM (Pulse Width Modulation)** to create smooth color transitions.

---

## 🧠 Overview
The KY-016 module contains a 4-pin RGB LED that allows mixing red, green, and blue light to produce a full range of colors.  
By adjusting the intensity of each color channel with PWM, the Arduino can generate smooth fading effects and color blends.

## 🔌 Wiring

| KY-016 Pin | Arduino Pin | Function |
|-------------|--------------|-----------|
| GND         | GND          | Common cathode (−) |
| R (Red)     | D3           | PWM output |
| G (Green)   | D6           | PWM output |
| B (Blue)    | D5           | PWM output |

> ⚠️ Make sure to use PWM-capable pins (3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 11 on the Uno).
