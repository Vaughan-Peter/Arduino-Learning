## 📁 File Descriptions

### `LEDWithSensor.ino`
- **Main Sketch** that connects everything together.
- Configures pins and loops through selected LED behavior modes.

### `BinaryCounter.h`
- Implements a binary counter using multiple LEDs.
- When the touch sensor is pressed, the counter increments and the LEDs show the binary value.
